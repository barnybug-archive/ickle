Version: 0.1-pre1
-----------------

This is the first release of ickle, so please be tolerant of bugs, and
the lack of features. Given time ickle will grow bigger.

ickle is in no way affiliated with 'ICQ' or 'Mirabilis'.


Prerequisites
-------------
You will need:
- gtkmm version 1.2.0 or above (preferably 1.2.5 or above)
- the sigc library
- gtk+ library

The last two should be installed if you have gtkmm working and
installed.

Note for RPM distributions (Redhat, SuSE, etc..) - make sure you
install the 'development' RPMs for all these libraries as
well. Usually these are called library-devel.rpm or similar.

Debian based distributions (Debian, Progeny, etc..) - you will need
these packages installed:
libgtkmm1.2
libgtkmm-dev
libgtk1.2
libgtk1.2-dev
libsigc++0
libsigc++-dev

Sources for these libraries can be found on or linked from:
http://gtkmm.sourceforge.net/

Compiling & Installation
------------------------
Generic configure instructions can be found in INSTALL. These are the
brief instructions for ickle:

1. Type './configure'

2. Type 'make' to compile the package.

3. Type 'make install' as root to install ickle.

Easy as that.

To run ickle you should be able to type simply 'ickle', assuming
/usr/local/bin is in your path.

Icons
-----

The default icons distributed with ickle are some designed by
me. They're not amazing but they do the job. I've also included some
more familiar ones in the directory icons.icq. At the moment the icons
are compiled into ickle, so if you want to use these alternate icons
do (before compiling):
mv icons icons.old
mv icons.icq icons
Then compile.

Comments, bug reports, etc..
----------------------------
Please send all your comments, wanted features and bug reports to:
  <barnaby@beedesign.co.uk>
