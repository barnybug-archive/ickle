Stuff to do:
(This are in rough order of when they will get done, most pressing first)

* Recording History

* Non-blocking DNS lookup

* Handle Rate Limit and SNAC Error packets

* Authorisation request/responses

* Reviewing History

* TCP Client-Client connections (a lot of work)

Things that are likely never to be included:

* File transfer (use FTP/HTTP!)

* Chat (use IRC!)
