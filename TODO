(This are in rough order of when they will get done, most pressing first)

* TCP Client-Client connections (a lot of work)

* Limit message length

* Parse Message too long error responses

* Authorisation request/responses

* Reviewing History

* Non-blocking DNS lookup

* Even More User info (some of the extended info isn't handled)

* Autoconnect on start up

* Moving contacts to top on message

* Better way of indicating messaged

* Web presence enable/disable

Things that are likely never to be included:

* File transfer (use FTP/HTTP!)

* Chat (use IRC!)
